### Come meet the folks at Brewing a Better Forest

This month we're excited to welcome [Brewing a Better Forest](http://www.brewingabetterforest.com/) 
to Open Twin Cities to talk about their organization and their civic tech 
project. Brewing a Better Forest's mission is to create a better urban forest by
blending a passion for trees with a passion for excellent craft beer.

Brewing a Better Forest is an emerging group of arborists and tree lovers who 
are passionate about trees and craft beer in the Twin Cities. The crew at 
Brewing a Better Forest strives to engage and encourage residents to notice, 
appreciate, and help water newly planted city trees. We are currently working 
with local craft brewers to help us spread the word of the importance of 
watering trees during their first few years on our boulevard.  We're asking 
Minneapolis residents to Adopt-A-Tree, and enjoy a beer on us!
