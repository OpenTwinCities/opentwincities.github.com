Join Open Twin Cities and Hennepin County for one of the most important civic
tech events in the Twin Cities. Geo:Code 2017 is a series of open data
workshops and conversations to connect people who live, work and govern in
Hennepin County. This year we will have two tracks: a county camp
*unconference* and, as in years past, coding space for an open hackathon.
Participants are welcome to participate in either or both tracks and to switch
through out the weekend. For more information, or to register and submit an
idea, please visit <http://www.hennepin.us/geocode>.

## Who is Geo:Code for?

Geo:Code is for everyone: residents, government personnel, novices, experts,
technologists and non-technologists. This event is for anybody who wants to
learn, discuss, and brainstorm about government data and technology. Whether
you are a student, an artist, an educator, a developer, a parent, a GIS
professional or a business owner you are welcome.

## Event Details

Over the past two years discussions, sessions, and projects covered topics as
diverse as service design, accessibility, transit and bicycle mapping,
recreation, an app to reach representatives, finding free, public meeting
spaces, lo-fi prototyping, usability, food access, arts integration, and why
data matters to non-technology community.

The format is part County Camp and part Code Space. The County Camp is a
modified [unconference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUEt0xOysr4) format and
participants will help set the agenda. Participants donâ€™t need any technology
to participate. The Code Space is a where participants can pick a project or
problem to tackle it with a team. If attendees plan to code, they should bring
any technology needed such as a laptop or tablet. Participants are welcome to
partake in any or all tracks and to switch between tracks during the weekend.
