[GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) is again opening its doors to Open 
Twin Cities and is letting us hold a meetup in their downtown St. Paul office! 
As always, this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on 
projects. Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or 
we'll try to match you up with an already existing project or idea.
