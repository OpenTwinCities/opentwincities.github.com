We're back at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) in downtown St. Paul! 
Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try
to match you up with an already existing project or idea. We'll have pizza and 
some great conversation.

Please comment below on any ideas or projects you might want to work on.
