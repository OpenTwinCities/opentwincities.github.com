This meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on projects. Come with
ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try to match
you up with an already existing project or idea.

### Code of Conduct

As with any event hosted by Open Twin Cities, our [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct/)
