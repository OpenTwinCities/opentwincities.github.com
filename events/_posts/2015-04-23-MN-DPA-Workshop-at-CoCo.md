The [Government Data Practices Act (DPA), Minnesota Statutes, chapter 13](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=13), 
creates a presumption that state and local government records are accessible 
to the public, unless a statute or rule provides otherwise.

Join [Tech.MN](http://tech.mn), the [Minnesota Coalition on Government Information (MNCOGI)](http://www.mncogi.org/about-us/), 
and [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org) on Monday, May 11th from 
6:30pm to 8:00pm at CoCo for a DPA workshop.

This free workshop will provide an overview of the DPA as it relates to your 
rights as a citizen around requesting and obtaining various public datasets. It 
will cover process and precedent while exploring tools and techniques. 
Participants can expect to increase their understanding of Minnesotaâ€™s DPA, 
achieve better outcomes in accessing their data, and identify local peers 
within the open data movement.

We believe that a more transparent government equates to a better state for all
to live, work and play. Join us if you share this belief and would like to know
more about how to get involved.
