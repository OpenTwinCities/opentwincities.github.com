excerpt: "<p>Civic tech isn't just about data, coding, and designing. There are a\
  \ lot of great books and articles out there that address society, culture, technology,\
  \ discrimination, economics, and all those other things we care about. So let\u2019\
  s read and talk about some of them!<br/>In February, we'll meet on a Saturday afternoon\
  \ at the Walker branch of Hennepin County Libraries to discuss \"Data and Goliath\"\
  , by Bruce Schneier. Schneier\u2019s book discusses the growing role of data collection\
  \ in business and government, and the immense surveillance potential this creates.\
  \ He also explores the communal values--such as justice, commercial fairness, and\
  \ security--that are at stake, and ends with concrete policy ideas for concerned\
  \ citizens.<br/>If you only have time to read part of the book, then skim one or\
  \ two of the sections that interests you most and we can compare notes! We look\
  \ forward to seeing you there!<br/>You can find the book at:<br/>- Hennepin County\
  \ Library (several copies available): <a class=\"linkified\" href=\"https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=smart&amp;q=data%20and%20goliath\"\
