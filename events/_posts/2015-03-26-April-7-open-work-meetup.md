We're happy to announce that [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) has 
opened its doors to Open Twin Cities and is letting us hold a meetup in their 
downtown St. Paul office! So, in addition to our regular 4th Tuesday meetups at 
the Humphrey School, we are also starting a series of meetups on the 1st Tuesday
of every month at GovDelivery.

Like our regular monthly meetup, his meeting will be an open lab time where we 
will work on projects. Come with ideas for projects, things you may have 
already started, or we'll try to match you up with an already existing project 
or idea.

If you're looking for project ideas, checkout: 

- [Adopt-A-Tree](https://github.com/ballPointPenguin/adopt-a-tree),
- the Northside Digital Innovation Alliance Digital Asset projects 
  ([Django Backend](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/ndia-django) and 
  [Angular Frontend](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/ndia-angular)),
- our [project and community management discussions](http://bit.ly/manageOTC),
- issues with the [Open Twin Cities website](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/opentwincities.github.com),or 
- the Open Twin Cities [Projects Page](/projects).
