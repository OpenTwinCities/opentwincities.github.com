is happening next week, and Open Twin Cities is going to be there through out
the event! If you're going to the IT Sympsoium, be sure to checkout one of our
sessions, or just come by and say 'hi':

### Open Government and Civic Tech Summit
- 12/8 - 8:30am - 11:45am

Organizations are using the new mindsets of open government, open data, and
civic technology to deliver new and improved services to residents. Join us as
we learn and discuss innovative civic technologies from around the world, the
open government and open data experiences of Minnesota governments, and help
shape the future of civic technology and open government in Minnesota via a
facilitated participatory discussion.

### Civic Tech in Minnesota - Vision and Practice
- 12/9 - 3:30pm - 4:30pm

Civic technology. Open government. Open data. What are these concepts, and how
do they work? Learn how to engage with residents for fresh perspectives, new
ideas, improved understanding, and perhaps some prototype services and
technologies. This session will include an overview of Hennepin County's
Geo:Code code-a-thon and Accessibility Jam as concrete examples of how to
implement an open government strategy.

### Open Twin Cities Table at the MN Innovation Center

- 12/9 and 12/10 - All Day

Since 2012, hundreds of Minnesotan residents, technologists, government
personnel, and issue experts have participated in civic technology events,
including Hack for MN, Capitol Code, Geo:Code, and CityCampMN, spurring dozens
of new technology ideas, and building a few as well. Find out 

 - About new ideas and innovative technologies created at these events;
 - How they were put on by a mix of government, non-profit, and for-profit organizations;
 - What ‘Civic Tech’, ‘Open Data’ and ‘Open Government’ mean

There will also be hands on demonstrations of applications that have been
created via civic technology from Minnesota and from across the country.
