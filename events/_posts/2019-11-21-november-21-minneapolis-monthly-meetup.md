excerpt: <p>This meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on projects.
  All skillsets and skill levels are welcome! We are a group that is dedicated to
  helping each other learn and explore things related to civic technology, open government,
  and open data. Come with ideas for projects or things you may have already started,
  or just bring yourself and we'll try to match you up with an already existing project,
  idea, or dataset to explore.</p>
