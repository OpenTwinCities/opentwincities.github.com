Civic tech isn't just about coding and designing. There are a lot of great
books and articles out there that address society, culture, technology,
discrimination, economics, and all those other things we care about. So let’s
read and talk about some of them!

In February, we'll meet on a Saturday afternoon at the Walker branch of
Hennepin County Libraries to discuss "Data and Goliath", by Bruce Schneier.
Schneier’s book discusses the growing role of data collection in business and
government, and the immense surveillance potential this creates. He also
explores the communal values--such as justice, commercial fairness, and
security--that are at stake, and ends with concrete policy ideas for concerned
citizens.

If you only have time to read part of the book, then skim one or two of the
sections that interests you most and we can compare notes! We look forward to
seeing you there!

You can find the book at:
- Hennepin County Library (several copies available): https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/search?t=smart&search_category=smart&q=data%20and%20goliath
- St. Paul Public Library (several copies available): http://alpha.sppl.org/search/?searchtype=X&SORT=D&searcharg=data+and+goliath

Note: This is a "bring your own coffee" event (if you find yourself needing
coffee on a Saturday morning). But please remember that the library only allows
covered beverages in the conference room.
