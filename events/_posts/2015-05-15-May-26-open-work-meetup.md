### The Service Design in Government Conference with Laura Andersen

In March 2015, Laura Andersen, Open Twin Cities Civic Design Lead, attended the 
Service Design in Government conference in London, England. Government 
representatives and designers from the UK, Europe, Canada, Australia and more 
presented on how they're including human-centered design perspective in 
government services and policy development. 

Join us on May 26th when Laura will share some of the high points of what she 
learned about what's going right and what's going . . . not so right as 
governments across the world test and iterate new and improved government 
services using service design. 

### We're Recording This

Want to see Laura's talk about Service Design in Government, but you can't make 
it to the Humphrey School? Well this month we're trying something again - we're 
going to record Laura's presentation! If all works out, we'll have a video of 
this presentation to share with everybody after the meetup.
