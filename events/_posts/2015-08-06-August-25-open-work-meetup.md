### Elections Tech with the City Clerk of Minneapolis

![Voting Booths](/images/posts/2015/08/election_booths.jpg)

The 2016 election is over a year away, but the City of Minneapolis is already 
planning for November 8, 2016. We're excited to welcome **Casey Carl, City Clerk of Minneapolis**, 
to the meetup to have a discussion about tools and ideas for the 2016 election.
Know of any great technologies other cities are using for elections? Have an 
idea for something new to make voting better? Come and brainstorm elections 
tech with Casey!
