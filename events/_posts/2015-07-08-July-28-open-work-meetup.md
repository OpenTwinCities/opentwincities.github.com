We'll be having our monthly open work meetup again at the Humphrey School on
July 28th at 6pm. Bring yourself, your skills, your passion, and your ideas.
We'll bring pizza.

### Minnesota Bikeways

Biking is strong in the Twin Cities, thanks to miles of trails and lanes, a big 
community, and lots of bike focused organizations. There are also a number of 
applications out there for bikers, but none that really meet the needs of Twin 
Cities bikers. At [Hennepin County's GeoCode](/2015/02/22/geocode-projects/#minnesota_bike_ways), 
the Minnesota Bikeways team set out to fix that, and started on a responsive 
prototype based on Open Street Maps and Leaflet. Since then, the MN Bikeways 
team has continued to develope their idea and their prototype. 

We're excited to welcome the Minnesota Bikeways team to the meetup! Join us on 
the 28th to learn more about the Minnesota Bikeways project and where it 
is heading.

### We're Recording This

Want to see the MN Bikeways talk, but you can't make it to the Humphrey School? 
Well this month we're trying something again - we're going to record the 
presentation! If all works out, we'll have a video of this presentation to 
share with everybody after the meetup.
