As usual, this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on projects.
Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try

## Gov IT Symposium Review and Geo:Code 2016 Preview

Last month Open Twin Cities helped to organize the Open Government Summit at
the [Minnesota Government IT Symposiumu](http://www.mngts.org/itsym/). There
was a lot of great discussion among Minnesota government IT professionals,
including some great responses to a few open questions we put up on the walls:

We're bringing these responses to the meetup, so please come by to find out
what Minnesota government IT professionals have to say about civic tech, open
data, and open government.

In addition to the IT Symposium, we're also going to talk about [Geo:Code 2016](http://www.hennepin.us/geocode),
the metro-wide civic tech event coming up in March. This will be the second
annual Geo:Code hosted by Hennepin County with help from Open Twin Cities, and
this year, a whole bunch of government, academic, and non-profit partners. Come
find out what Geo:Code is all about, and talk about some ideas for issues to
focus on during the event.
