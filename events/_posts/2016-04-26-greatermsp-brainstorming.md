## May 5th Update - Postponing

Unforuntately, we are postponing the Regional Dashboard Hack Session to a yet
to be determined date. While we have not yet set a new date, we anticipate it
will be sometime in late June. We appologize for the confusion and inconvience
that this causes.

# Event Description

Come spend an afternoon with your fellow civic technologists and GreaterMSP
talking and thinking about how to crowdsource what's happening in the Twin
Cities. Designers, programmers, community organization representatives, project
managers, surveyors, data analysts, anybody with passion; come share your
experience, wisdom, and ideas.

## We'll Consider

 - What would an MVP look like for a tech platform that enables
   leaders/organizations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul to tell us 1) they are
   working on one or more of the dashboard metrics 2) what “levers” can be
   pulled on that metric to create change and 3) what are the proven solutions
   for an individual metric that could be scaled for improved performance?
 - How much would it cost, how quickly could it be built, and who could do
   build it?

## Why

 - **Project**: The Regional Indicators Dashboard provides shared, objective
   metrics to track the region’s overall success on critical economic,
   environmental and social outcomes.
 - **Opportunity**: We’re using data to recognize shared challenges and impact
   our ability to come together: A Regional Competitiveness Working Group was
   formed to interpret, communicate and act on the data.
 - **Barrier**: We don’t know who’s working to drive change and which levers
   drive it. We need to figure this out as efficiently as possible
