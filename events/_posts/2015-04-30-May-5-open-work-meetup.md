We're happy to be holding another St. Paul Open Twin Cities meetup at 
[GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/). Like all of our regular monthly 
meetups, this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on projects. 
Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try
to match you up with an already existing project or idea.

If you're looking for project ideas, checkout: 

- [Adopt-A-Tree](https://github.com/ballPointPenguin/adopt-a-tree),
- the Northside Digital Innovation Alliance Digital Asset projects 
  ([Django Backend](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/ndia-django) and 
  [Angular Frontend](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/ndia-angular)),
- our [project and community management discussions](http://bit.ly/manageOTC),
- issues with the [Open Twin Cities website](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/opentwincities.github.com),or 
- the Open Twin Cities [Projects Page](/projects).
