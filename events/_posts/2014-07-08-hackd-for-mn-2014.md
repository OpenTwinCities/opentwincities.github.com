The Hackathon was just the beginning - we want to support the great ideas and 
enthusiasm ignited at Hack for MN so that we can continue Hacking for Good in 
Minnesota!

Join us July 8 at DevJam for drinks and apps and to: 

* Hear from teams who have continued developing projects conceived at hackathons
* Meet with mentors who can help you figure out your next steps
* Connect with teams looking for your talents and skills

Based on the projects that come out of Hack for MN, we'll also be inviting 
government data partners and agencies who might be interested in the projects 
or able to provide guidance.
