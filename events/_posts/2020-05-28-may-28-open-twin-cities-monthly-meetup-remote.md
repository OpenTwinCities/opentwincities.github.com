excerpt: <p>In response to the covid-19 social distancing recommendations, we will
  continue connecting remotely for our monthly meetups. We'll try to devote some extra
  time to checking in with each other and sharing thoughts/ideas/experiences that
  help us form a constructive response to recent events. We may also group up into
  breakout rooms if there are projects/topics that folks want to dive a little deeper
  into. (If you have a project/topic you'd like to discuss, also feel free to add
  it to the agenda ahead of time.)</p>
