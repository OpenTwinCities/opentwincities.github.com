We're excited to visit the beautiful [Union Depot](http://www.uniondepot.org/)
this month! Thank you to Ramsey County for opening up their space in the Depot,
and for providing this month's dinner!

Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try
to match you up with an already existing project or idea. We'll have food and
some great conversation.

### Met Council Data with Todd Graham

The Metropolitan Council, our regional planning agency and provider of
metro-wide services including Metro Transit, [produces](http://www.metrocouncil.org/Data-and-Maps.aspx)
and [publishes](https://gisdata.mn.gov/organization/us-mn-state-metc) a lot of
data. Todd Graham, Principal Forecaster at the Met Council, is going to stop by
and tell us a bit about all this data and talk about the types of questions it
might help answer.
