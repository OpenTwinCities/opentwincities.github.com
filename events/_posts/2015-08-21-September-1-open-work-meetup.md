We're back at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) in downtown St. Paul! 
Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try
to match you up with an already existing project or idea. We'll have pizza and 
some great conversation.

Please comment below on any ideas or projects you might want to work on.

### St. Paul Elections Prep

[St. Paul is going to have an election is a couple of months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul_City_Council_election,_2015), 
and [E-Democarcy has some ideas](http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/stpaul-issues/elections)
on how to help St. Paul residents get to know their candidates. At this meetup,
we're going to focus on two projects that will help St. Paulites connect with 
people running for office:

- **Crowd Sourced Candidate Info**: E-Democracy has started a Google 
  Spreadsheet for gathering the websites, social media, and other contact 
  information of candidates: <http://bit.ly/stpaul15data> . Everybody is 
  welcome to add and update this spreadsheet, so let's spend some time at the
  meetup searching and filling in the missing information. Scour the internet,
  have some food, and make a great contribution to informed elections in
  St. Paul!
- **Try out Your Next Representative**: For those looking to play with python 
  and HTML, we'll also be taking a look at MySociety's [Your Next Representative](https://github.com/mysociety/yournextrepresentative) project.
  [DataMade](http://datamade.us/) is going to setup an instance for the Twin 
  Cities. So let's poke around a bit and see if there anything we want to 
  change.

#### Join the Conversation Today

No need to wait until September 1st to talk and contribute. You can join
