  To support Geo:Coders who want an early start on their projects, MN.IT 
  Services and Open Twin Cities are hosting a pre-event workshop on 
  January 31st at the Minneapolis Central Library. Geo:Code Accessibility Jam 
  will use Service Design to learn about accessibility and usability and their
  role in developing more effective civic technology and open data initiatives.
  Coming out of the Jam, you will be prepared to put what you’ve learned into
  practice at Geo:Code Code-a-thon, and will be familiar with a powerful 
  process for creating technologies and services that are truly accessible to
