Open data + CartoDB = Map-stravaganza!

This month, we'll be holding a joint meeting with MaptimeMSP to bring together
the power of open data with the visual thrill of maps! Come ready to learn
about open data, maps, and how you can combine the two to make exciting
visualizations.  The plan:

1. Maptime MSP member, [Molly McDonald](https://twitter.com/MollyWynia), will
   demo CartoDB for us, a powerful but easy-to-use mapping tool.
2. Open Twin Cities will demo some of the Minnesota open data portals.
3. We'll break up into teams and start mapping some of our favorite open data
   sets together.
4. At the end of the meetup, we'll demo our maps and choose our favorites!
   (Prizes may be involved.)
