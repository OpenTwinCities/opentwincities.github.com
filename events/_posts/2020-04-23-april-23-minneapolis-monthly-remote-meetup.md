excerpt: <p>In response to the covid-19 social distancing recommendations, we will
  be connecting remotely for our monthly meetup. We know this can be a stressful time
  for folks, so we want to give everyone a chance to connect and be social, but at
  a safe distance. We also know that remote meetings can get a little chaotic, so
  we're adding an agenda below to help structure the experience a bit. We'll try to
  devote some extra time to checking in with each other and sharing thoughts/ideas/experiences
  that help us form a constructive response to recent events. We may also group up
  into breakout rooms if there are topics that folks want to dive a little deeper
  into.</p>
