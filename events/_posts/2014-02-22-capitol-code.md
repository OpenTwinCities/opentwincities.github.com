The Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State and its partners are proud to
invite you to Capitol Code: An Open Data Jam, to help build the Minnesota of
the 21st century using public data — and your ideas.

All citizens are welcome to generate ideas and solutions alongside analysts,
business and community leaders, designers, government officials, media,
software innovators and others.

## What

Capitol Code: An Open Data Jam is a one-day event driven by passionate and
engaged citizens given the opportunity to explore and drive solutions using
public data from the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State. Participants
are called on to apply existing technologies or build new applications using
public data.

The Capitol Code public data sets available are related to voting and
elections, such as polling place data and election results, as well as
information from the office’s Business Services Division.

> Public data is a tremendous resource for Minnesotans, and I’m excited to see
> the innovation, new business and employment opportunities that can be
> generated by using this information. – Secretary of State Mark Ritchie

## Why

Minnesota needs your ideas, energy, diverse perspectives and skills to ignite
innovation that can result in great solutions for our communities.
