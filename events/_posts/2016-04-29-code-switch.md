Code Switch is intense, fast-paced, extremely fun [organized] chaos. Code
Switch is a free two-day civic hackathon that seeks to achieve maximum social
impact by expanding participation among members of underserved communities.
Everybody is welcome to join diverse project teams to brainstorm and create
products and solutions to enhance economic opportunity, education, health, and
safety in underserved communities.

We provide breakfast, lunch, caffeine, wifi, and a beautiful space to work. You
provide the creativity.

## Is this event for me? Really?

**Yes**. Code Switch is for everyone. Tired of seeing problems in your
community continue to go unsolved, and, in many cases, get worse? Join us at
Code Switch. You hold the key to understanding issues and opportunities in your
own community. Code Switch is for you.

**Ask yourself these questions**:

- Have you ever had the thought, “This service should be easier”?
- Have you ever had an idea for how to strengthen your community but did not
  know how to get started?
- Are you frustrated that you have been unable to use your skills to help solve
  critical social problems?
- Are you curious about the entrepreneurial approach of the technical community
  and want to see how it works?

If you answered yes, then join us at Code Switch to help us find paths to
closing gaps and create new opportunities. [Register TODAY](1)!

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is an event in which community members, designers, project
managers, programmers, and people who just want to learn, collaborate
intensively on projects. There are no fixed rules for what Code Switch project
teams can work on. Projects can be technical or non-technical. Projects can be
proposed by _**anybody**_ (yes, anybody). You don't need a detailed plan.
Projects can begin and end at Code Switch, so don't feel like proposing a
project means you'll have to maintain them forever. Some projects will be
created on the day of the event and some projects teams will decide to join
forces. This is your event, you decide how you spend your time! Don't be shy,
we are an open, supportive community who want to see you succeed!

**Great solutions are born when innovators from the community are involved in the development process—from ideation to launch.**

Our goal is to work together to develop ideas for solutions for problems that
affect Minnesotans. Here are some example outcomes of potential projects:

- An app that helps people find affordable housing
- A get out the vote plan for your neighborhood
- A website for discovering high performing schools
- A service to locate nearby job openings
- An interactive map that shows neighborhood living costs and economic opportunities

To get your creative juices flowing, we have also identified a few “challenge
areas” for you to consider when thinking about projects:

- Closing the Achievement Gap
- Economic Opportunity
- Civic engagement
- Health & Wellness
- Connected Cities: improve access and safety for communities of color

For more inspiration, have a look at the recent [GeoCode 2.0](2) event where
participants focused on issues of geography and technology in the Twin Cities.
