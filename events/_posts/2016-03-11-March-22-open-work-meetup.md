This month we'll be joined by special guest **Amy Riegelman**, Assistant
Librarian at the University of Minnesota Libraries, to talk about:

## Grappling with Discoverability Consequences + Discovering Gov Web Analytics

When it comes to being mobile-friendly, Minnesota is not very nice. Learn about
Google's algorithm changes and why Minnesota state web pages are buried in
search results. Also learn about how 18F, a digital services agency of the
federal government, created tool called [Analytics.usa.gov](http://analytics.usa.gov/).
This tool allows for realtime access to usage statistics of government web
pages. This open source project is in the public domain which means that other
government entities are able to replicate this level of web traffic
transparency.

The rest of this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on
projects. Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or
we'll try to match you up with an already existing project or idea.
