### Learn About Poplus From Steven Clift

This month we're excited to welcome [Steven Clift](http://stevenclift.com/),
Executive Director of [E-Democracy](http://e-democracy.org), to Open Twin Cities.
Steven is dropping by to tell us about Poplus, an international open source 
project and community that's establishing standards to enable civic 
technologies to work together. In addition, Poplus is creating civic technology
components - plugin-like bits of code that organizations and developers can use
to quickly add common civic tech functionality to their applications. You can 
learn more about Poplus at their [website](http://poplus.org/), see code at 
their [GitHub](https://github.com/poplus/), and join the discussion on their 
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus).

### We're Recording This

Want to see Steven's talk about Poplus, but you can't make it to the Humphrey
School? Well this month we're trying something new - we're going to record
Steven's presentation! If all works out, we'll have a video of this 
presentation to share with everybody after the meetup.

#### Update - MP3 of Steve's Presentation

Well, everything didn't quite work out, and we lost the video of Steve's
presentation. However, we did save the audio of Steve's Poplus presentation!

You can listen to the MP3 below. You can also [download the MP3 from SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/opentwincities/steven-clift-presentation-on-poplus-at-open-twin-cities).
