  We'll be having our monthly open work meetup again at Anderson Hall on
  February 23rd at 6pm. 
  This month we'll be joined by special guest <strong>Kevin Dyke</strong>,
  spatial data analyst and curator at the John R. Borchert Map Library, to talk
  about <strong>GIS and Open Data</strong> Bring yourself, your skills, your
  passion, and your ideas. We'll bring pizza.

As usual, this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on projects.
Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or we'll try
to match you up with an already existing project or idea.

This month we'll be joined by special guest **Kevin Dyke**, spatial data analyst
and curator at the John R. Borchert Map Library, to talk about:

### Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Open Data

As a cartographer and web developer, Kevin loves open data, but thinks we all
must continually remind ourselves that the open data we receive from
governments and agencies are not objective neutral objects, and that we must
approach both the source and content of that data with a questioning eye.
Kevin also has an interest in the broader history of technology, and how
choices in technological development, both spoken and unspoken, documented and
undocumented, have profound effects on the fabric of society.  Come join us for
a critical conversation about the legacy and the future of GIS and open data!

The rest of this meeting will be an open lab time where we will work on
projects. Come with ideas for projects, things you may have already started, or
we'll try to match you up with an already existing project or idea.
