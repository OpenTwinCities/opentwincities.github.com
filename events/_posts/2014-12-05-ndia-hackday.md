We believe that digital connectivity and skills are a civil rights issue of the 
21st century. As part of a broader effort by the 
[Northside Digital Innovation Alliance](http://www.digitalempowermentacademy.org/#!ndia)
(NDIA) to ensure that residents of North Minneapolis have access to Internet 
connected computers and digital skills training opportunities, the NDIA is 
working to build a Northside Digital Assets website with direct input from North Minneapolis residents that will help residents find places in their communiy to access and learn about information technology.

Please join the NDIA - including [Open Twin Cities](/), the 
[Digital Empowerment Academy](http://www.digitalempowermentacademy.org/), and 
the [Technology Literacy Collaborative](http://tlc-mn.org/) - for a working 
session focused on the Northside Digital Assets website. Learn about the goals 
of the Northside Digital Assets site from Lanise Block, and hear about findings 
from the City of Minneapolis' 
[Community Technology Survey](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/it/inclusion/WCMS1P-107901) 
on how connected and comfortable with technology communities around Minneapolis 
are. After that it will be time to talk about, design, and build a prototype of 
the website.

What will this prototype be? That's up to you!

This event is free, and lunch will be provided.
