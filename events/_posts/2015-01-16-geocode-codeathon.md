## Transparency & Accessibility

Hennepin County is celebrating the [first year of its Open GIS policy](/2014/02/12/ramsey-and-hennepin-pass-opengis/) 
by taking part in [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) and 
[Code for America’s CodeAcross](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/). 
Residents are invited to explore [government data](http://www.hennepin.us/gisopendata), 
experiment with civic technologies, and collaborate with Hennepin County on 
solutions for problems facing your community. Inspired by civic technology 
principals, we’re excited to support the creation of a more transparent 
Hennepin County and information and services that are accessible to all 
residents.
