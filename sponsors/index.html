      <p>The Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA) strives to be a nationally recognized model for university-community engagement. CURA is founded on the belief that partnership between the university and the community is mutually beneficial. Communities determine issues important to them, and provide an understanding of the context of these issues and the wisdom to shape how they can best be addressed to create vital places to live and work. The university contributes extensive knowledge and expertise to understand community issues and discover new approaches to address them. This model of engaged research leads to outcomes that strengthen the community and enrich academic research. </p>
