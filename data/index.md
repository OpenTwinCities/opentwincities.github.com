### Open Twin Cities Open Data Portal

<https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/brigade?brigade=Open%20Twin%20Cities>

Socrata has graciously provided Open Twin Cities with a Code for America Brigade

governments. The datasets found on this portal can be downloaded in a number of
formats, investigated in browser, and many are also available in a APIs hosted 
on the platfrom.
