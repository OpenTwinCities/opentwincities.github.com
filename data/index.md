### Open Twin Cities Socrata Data Portal

<https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/brigade?brigade=Open%20Twin%20Cities>

Socrata has graciously provided Open Twin Cities with a Code for America Brigade 
data portal to host datasets that we have received or requested from local 
governments. The datasets found on this portal can be downloaded in a number of
formats, investigated in browser, and many are also available in a APIs hosted 
on the platfrom.

### Minnesota Data Collection Spreadsheet

[Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtkFCdxQ11AOdGpWWnpuVzdaNG1SVG40MXlyZ0hSVEE#gid=13)

An advanced Google spreadsheet collecting and cataloging 1000's of datasets
available for Minnesota. Including a single place to search for links to
datasets included on MetroGIS, MNGeo, MN DNR, and more. This was created by a
team participating in the 
[Open Twin Cities 2013 Open Data Day/CodeAcross Hackathon](/events/2013/02/23/open-data-day-hackathon/)

### Capitol Code Data Page

<http://capitolcode.mn.gov/data/>

A page created for [Capitol Code: An Open Data Jam](/events/2014/02/22/capitol-code/)
- Minnesota's 2014 Open Data Day/CodeAcross event. This page lists the datasets
featured that day, with links to available downloads and API endpoints, and
brief descriptions of the dataset. Includes a Table of Contents for easier
browsing. Datasets from the following organizations are listed:

* Secretary of State
* Minnesota Geospatial Information Office
* Department of Agriculture
* Department of Natural Resources
* Pollution Control Agency
* Department of Transportation
* State Demographic Center
* US Census
* Center for Urban and Regional Affairs at the University of Minnesota

### City of Minneapolis Open Data Portal

<http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/>

The City of Minneapolis' general purpose open data portal, created as part of
the city's 2014 [Open Data Policy](/2014/07/31/minneapolis-passes-open-data-policy/).

### City of Minneapolis GIS Data Portal

<http://cityoflakes.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html>

The City of Minneapolis provides GIS datasets on an ArcGIS Dataportal. Datasets
include Fire Station Locations, Snow Emergency Routes, Community Gardens, and
much more.

### City of Minneapolis Other Useful Map Data

<http://www.minneapolismn.gov/maps/about_maps_public-maps-links>

Minneapolis also provides a number of GIS datasets that can be downloaded.
Includes City, Community, Neighborhood, Ward, and Park boundaries. Also 
includes street centerlines, bodies of water, railroads, precinct finder,
police maps, historic districts, and much more.

### Hennepin County GIS Data Portal

* **Official Portal**: <http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/open-government/gis-open-data>
* **Server with GeoJSON and Shapefiles**: <http://data.dbspatial.com/hennepin/>

Following [Hennepin County's resolution to allow open access to the county's
GIS data](/2014/02/12/ramsey-and-hennepin-pass-opengis/), the County created
a GIS data portal. Currently, this portal includes GIS data on taxable parcels,
address points, the boundaries of the county, street centerlines, alternate
names for streets, municipal boundaries, aerial imagery, commissioner 
districts, and topography.

Hennepin County is sharing data on this portal free of license and charge, the 
in format that Hennepin County stores and uses these datasets - ERSI 
Geodatabase. There are [concerns that Geodatabase does not lend itself to free
and accessible use](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/twin-cities-brigade/kAip-krnO8g/Yht9GvUq3JMJ).
To address these concerns, the Open Twin Cities community has worked
together to convert Hennepin County's provided Geodatabase files into GeoJSON
and Shapefiles, and [dbSpatial](http://dbspatial.com) has provided space to
host these converted files.

### State of Minnesota Department of Health Data Access

<https://apps.health.state.mn.us/mndata/>

Includes health and environmental data for each county, as well as statewide
data on specific health and environmental factors. Site includes interactive
maps, data querying tools, and CSV downloads.

### State of Minneosta Geospatial Commons

<http://gisdata.mn.gov/>

The Minnesota Geospatial Commons (the Commons) is a collaborative place for users and publishers of geospatial resources in Minnesota.

The Commons is primarily for geospatial data consumers: people who need data for a project, services for an application, or some other resource required for a GIS-based use. It is a robust data distribution site that can be used by both traditional and non-traditional GIS users, such as web developers, journalists and others. The Commons is not intended to provide web mapping functionality like “Google Maps” or “ArcGIS Online.”

#### Timeline for the Commons

The Commons will be publicly released by June 30, 2014. On June 30 there will be many GIS datasets on the site. Over the summer and fall of 2014, more datasets will be added as GIS data sites, like DNR Data Deli, are fully transitioned to the Minnesota Geospatial Commons. The plan for the Commons is to replace the existing state agency geospatial data delivery systems, including DNR Data Deli, MetroGIS DataFinder and MnGeo's GeoGateway.
