Here is a summary of the fourteen projects that were worked on and presented at
the 2016 Geo:Code Twin Cities Code-a-thon.

Delays due to road construction are always frustrating, especially since
_somebody_ _somewhere_ has the information to help the public to avoid these
delays. The Collaborative Road Construction team (a.k.a. the Orange Cone Heads)
thought through how best to share this information on road closures and delays
with the public, and explored what is preventing that from happening now. The
team suggested that Waze provides a strong industry standard that Twin Cities
governments should provide their data in. In doing so, multiple governments
would not only provide data in a single format - thus making it easier to create
a metro-wide tool, but they would also provide data in a format that is ready
to integrate into already widely used traffic tools, including Waze. Step 1,
however, is finding out which Twin Cities counties even have publicly accessible
construction and delay data in any formation. As the Orange Cone Heads
discovered while creating a story map of Twin Cities counties, several do not
provide this data at all, or only provide a subset of data that could help the
public when dealing with delays and construction.
