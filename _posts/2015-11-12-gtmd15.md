**Open Twin Cities fosters an inclusive community of civic collaboration and civic technology for positive social impact.**

We are a [Code for America Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/), a 
group of civic innovators with a stated goal of including all of our creative 
community, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, gender or age. 

We have embedded service design processes that put community members at the 
core; for example, a service design process used at [Hack for MN 14](/events/2014/06/21/hack-for-mn-2014/) 
resulted in [Heading Home Projects](/2014/07/16/hack-for-mn-2014-heading-home-projects/) 
to support homeless veterans.


In the past three years, we have...

- Built one of the largest regional online civic tech communities in the U.S.
- Hosted and partnered on 8 one- or two-day facilitated events collaboratively engaging community stakeholders and volunteer technologists in building prototype tools to address local community issues
- Created a 300+ member [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/twin-cities-brigade) focused on open data and civic technology, a newsletter with 500+ subscribers, and 1000+ social media followers
- Held 50+ [Monthly Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/OpenTwinCities/), Book Clubs, and other civic tech events
- Helped launch the [Minneapolis Open Data Policy](/2014/07/31/minneapolis-passes-open-data-policy/)
- Raised ~$60,000 in [grants and sponsorships](/sponsors/)

**Through these efforts we will harness the power of civic technology and data to help local communities better meet the pressing challenges of the 21st century.  [Join us!](/)**
