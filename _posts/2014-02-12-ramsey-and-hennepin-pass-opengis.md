MetroGIS's recommendation that metro counties provide free and open access to
their GIS data by approving open GIS resolutions!

Note that during the discussion MetroGIS is acknowledged for all of the work
they have put in researching and arguing for open GIS, and E-Democracy is noted
for its support of open data.

### Hennepin County Board Vote

The Hennepin County vote is a much quicker affair; the open GIS resolution was
part of a larger, previously agreed upon consent item. However, a more 
significant discussion about the open GIS did occur a week earlier during the 
Februrary 4th meeting of the Library, Technology & General Government 
Committee. Video of that discussion is below.

Congratulations and thank you to MetroGIS on everything they've done to reach
this point.
