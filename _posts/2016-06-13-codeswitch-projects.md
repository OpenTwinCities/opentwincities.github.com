Here is a summary of the nine projects that were worked on and presented at
this year's Code Switch.

## [Attune](#attune) {#attune}

Our world is divided. While many nations, including the United States,
have remarkably diverse populations, these different populations are
often divided by the fear of different races, religions, orientations,
and nationalities. Why does this fear persists despite our similarities
far, far outnumbering our differences? Attune believes this fear is
rooted in an inability to empathize with others. Inspired by the power
of travel, and of the connective power of sharing economy businesses
like AirBnB, Attune developed an idea for a business that enables those
who are curious about the lives and cultures of different people to live
with hosts of different backgrounds. Attune believes that by living life
with a host of a different background, people will develop empathy for
others, and come to understand that we are, in fact, much more alike
than different.

Kids learn so much from video games - so much about the characters,
story, and mechanisms of video games. Imagine what kids would learn if
these characters, stories, and mechanisms were based on scientific
concepts. Would this increase the scientific literacy of our society?
Would this make scientific concepts easier to teach in school? Would we
all have a better understanding of our own bodies, and the diseases that
might impact them? These are the ideas and questions that the
Educational Games team explored at Code Switch. Inspired by these ideas,
the team created a prototype of a game based on the real mechanisms of
biomolecule transportation in nerve cells.

The Leadz team wants youth of color to learn from and be inspired by
professionals of color. To that end, the team has created a Wordpress
site to house profiles, videos, and advice from scientists, engineers,
artists, lawyers, and many more professionals of color. With this
content as a start, and a contact form to entice more mentors to share
their stories, the team has also planned future features to strength
these mentoring relationships, including Skype integration for
one-on-one mentoring discussions, and an algorithm for matching youth
with adults based on their interests and passions.

Public benefits are complicated. It is difficult to know what you might
be eligible for, or how changes in income will affect the benefits you
receive. Actually applying for benefits involves filling out individual
applications for each benefit, despite the fact that these applications
ask many similar questions. Benefit eligibility and application forms
were not designed with user experience in mind, so the Livewell team
focused on a benefits eligibility and application tool that is. The
Livewell team created a person and wireframes, and researched benefit
criteria, in order to design a mobile and text ready web application
that will quickly and easily help residents to understand what benefits
they are eligible for, how changes in income might impact the benefits
they receive, and fill out and submit benefit application forms.

## [Neighborhood Stories](#neighborhood-stories) {#neighborhood-stories}

Stories are embedded in data, and there is a lot of data out there about
our cities and neighborhoods. The Neighborhood Stories team worked on
bringing those data embedded stories to the surface, so that we
residents can learn about and discuss the places we live. The team
created a map based prototype that allows a user to explore various
topics - health, education, housing - in their neighborhoods. Each topic
includes a high level statement about that topic based on data, as well
as a space to discuss the topic via social media.

## [Open Beds](#open-beds) {#open-beds}

On a regular basis, people experiencing homelessness encounter an
information problem: where is there a bed I can sleep in tonight? While
there are often beds available on a given night, a person experiencing
homelessness can often only discover this by physically visiting a given
shelter. In addition to the basic question of whether a bed is
available, people experiencing homelessness also have to navigate the
restrictions and characteristics of shelters. Is there a curfew? Does
the shelter have a religious affiliation? The Open Beds team set out to
address this information asymmetry by designing and prototyping an
online and mobile application, with information provided by shelters,
that allows users to quickly view the number of open beds at a shelter,
as well as additional information about that shelter.

## [Renters Helper](#renters-helper) {#renters-helper}

Landlords hold considerable power in their relationship with renters. As
property owners, landlords are the party who ultimately decide to fix
appliances, maintain building infrastructure, eradicate infestations,
and address other issues related to the livability of a property.
Elements of this relationship are regulated, and violations of a given
property owner and a property are public data. This means little
however, if renters are unaware of these regulations or what this data
has to say. Renter Helper seek to address this information asymmetry by
analyzing existing public data on landlords and properties, and
collecting additional data from renters, in order to create a score that
represents how well a property is taken care of. In addition to this
score, the team wireframed a website and app that helps connect renters
with this analysis and other important information.

## [RxLife](#rxlife) {#rxlife}

For individuals who take prescription drugs, or caregivers for those
individuals, keeping track of the variety, schedules, and interactions
of medication can be dangerously confusing. RxLife’s goal is to reduce
the confusion by helping users to manage and view the very important
information associated with prescription drugs. Over the weekend, RxLife
created a functional prototype of a mobile app that keeps a list and
schedule of current and past drugs that a patient is prescribed, with
the option to notify users when it is time to take medication. The team
also explored ways to help patients to manage the complications of
prescription drugs, with an idea for adding alerts when a drug is added
that interacts with existing medication, and creating an easy to
understand listing of drugs, foods, and activities that should be
avoided while on active medication.

Debates are important events in elections. In some cases, they can
reshape campaigns and define the history of our political contests. What
can we learn if we apply data and text analysis to transcripts of these
pivotal events? Who Says What dug into that question, based on
transcripts for every presidential debate since 1964. The team scraped
this data from the web and started defining a variety of questions and
hypotheses to drive analysis of this data, such as frequency of words,
percentage of speaking time, likelihood of generating applause, and when
speakers actually address questions. Of these, Who Says What created and
presented visualizations and statistical models for variations of two of
these questions: who has spoken most during this 2016 Republican
Presidential debates?; and can we predict when a Republican debater will
say something that leads to an applause?

## [Ruby Bridge](#ruby-bridge) {#ruby-bridge}

Ruby Bridge was not a public issue project like the above, and did not
present at the end of Code Switch. This was a workshop held during Code
Switch that introduced the fundamentals of the Ruby programming language
to participants. During the Code Switch weekend, Ruby Bridge
participants went through the Learn to Code curriculum from RailsBridge.
Together with workshop organizers, participants went through topics that
included Ruby basics, the command line, common data structures and
control flows (variables, arrays, strings, files, loops), object
orientation, how to execute Ruby, and how to create and host a simple
website.
