### Airstatus 

- Contact: [Richard Barnes](http://rbarnes.org/)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969465)
- Awarded: Meeting with Otto Doll, CIO of the City of Minneapolis
- [GitHub](https://github.com/r-barnes/airquality)
- [Demo](http://airstatus.info/)
- SMS Number: 443-201-AIRQ (text zipcode for air status in your area)

Aiming to create a single API of air quality information based on many different
data sources across the U.S. and the world, to make it easy for designers and 
developers to include air quality information in their apps and sites. By the 
end of Hack for MN, the API could provide information from approximately 3000
stations across North America, and the team was working on pulling in 
air quality information from the U.K. and Germany.

The team also created a demo web and text application to map, visualize, and 
retrieve air quality information based on the Airstatus API. Besides 
demonstrating how to use of the API, this application also provides an 
environment for the team to experiment with ways of displaying highly technical
information to the general public.

### PLANIT 

- Contact: [Alison Link](https://twitter.com/linkalis)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969467)
- Awarded: Meeting with DeAnna Cummings, Executive Director of Juxtaposition Arts
- [Minneapolis Park Boundaries Dataset](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/dataset/Metro-Parks-in-Minneapolis/hnpv-xa5t)

This project, which was first pitched at [CityCampMN 2013 hackathon](/events/2013/11/09/citycampmn/), 
started with the task of creating a single place for residents to be able to view and 
plan informal activities at city parks, like pickup basketball games. The team 
was also motivated by the questions of how to engage youth in nearby activities, 
and how to help individuals meet people at parks. 

"It's like a Yelp for activities"

The bulk of team PLANIT's work during Hack for MN involved creating a dataset 
and map of  Minneapolis parks that includes information on activities and 
services provided at parks, based on combining data from the City of 
Minneapolis and Hennepin County.

With that accomplished, the team now wants to build a way for individuals and
residents to be able to submit their own activities, and for folks to be able
to use this platform via text messaging.


### The API Store {#api-store}

- Contact: [David Ching](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=159829397)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969464)
- Awarded: Meeting with Carolyn Parnell, CIO of the State of Minnesota
- [Post of History](/2014/06/13/capitol-code-update-government-api-store/)

Continuing their work from [Capitol Code/CodeAcross 2014](/2014/02/27/capitol-code-projects/), 
the API Store team has been tackling the business, policy, and political issues
that come about when a government decides to make its data openly available as
downloadable datasets or APIs. Having established the framework of open data 
publishers and subscribers, the API Store team has begun to identify the 
expectations and responsibilities of these two groups, and the characteristics of
the relationship between these two groups.

The API Store team has examined two important features that a government open
data portal should have: a catalog of all open data provided by that government; 
and analytics on the use of published data for the benefit of both publishers 
(to understand what datasets are popular and the sources of extreme demand) and
users (to better understand performance issues of applications that use open 
data).


### Voter Guide

- Contact: [Steve Clift](https://twitter.com/democracy) and [Tim Erikson](https://twitter.com/stpaultim) 
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969463)
- Awarded: Agile consulting session with Dion Stewart, Agile Coach at DevJam Studios
- [Project Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2NYYG3_rUPLK_VujVXORndnFUXLiVs_DJZZbcgmqNE/edit) - Includes links to crowdsourced MN House Candidate social media accounts
- [Demo](http://dev-voter-guide.gotpantheon.com/)

Building upon the crowd-sourcing and visualization work of a [Capitol Code 2014 project](/2014/02/27/capitol-code-projects/),
the Voter Guide team began by seeking to expand the collected social media 
accounts of Minnesota politicians to include 2014 candidates for office.
Once they expanded their scope to candidates, the team decided they could also
expand their scope to create a full guide for voters on all of the candidates
that are running in their district(s), beginning with a site that makes it easy
for voters to find the social media accounts of their candidates.

With a Drupal site running that does just that, the team is now looking at what
other information would be useful to include for voters, including official information (such as campaign contributions). The team is also planning on
creating an API so other sites and developers can easily incorporate this
important information.


### Homescreen for the Homeless

- Contact: [Colin Lee](https://twitter.com/colinmlee)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98969462)
- Awarded: Service Design consultation with Laura Andersen, Owner of Praidea
- [GitHub](https://github.com/colintheshots/HomelessHomeScreen)
- [Play Store Page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=colintheshots.homelesshomescreen)

Based on the observation that smartphones are becoming more prevalent among
homeless populations, and that basic information about resources available for
the homeless can be very hard to find, this team created an Android app to 
provide a simplified listing of social services and homeless assistance programs.

Homescreen for the Homeless organizes and lists phone numbers, URLs, and apps
that can connect homeless populations with various resources, such as 
shelters, health and legal resources. These resources are organized based on focus or
situation, and intelligently integrate with the smartphone to form appropriate
actions, such as dialing a phone number or opening an installed app. 

With a prototype of the Android app built, the team is now looking at the
problem of gathering lists of homelessness and social service resources. To
that end, the team is planning to crowd-source phone numbers, URLs, and apps
that can connect homeless individuals with resources they want or need.


### PyLadies Web Scraping

- Contact: [Dana Engebretson](https://twitter.com/DanaKE/)
- [Video](http://vimeo.com/98964771)
- Awarded: Meeting with Nancy Lyons, President & CEO of Clockwork Active Media

By combining data from the Meetup API with the power of Python web scrapping, 
the new [PyLadies Twin Cities](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesTC/) group wanted
to track, analyze, and visualize the representation of women in Twin Cities
technology meetups. And ultimately, they want more women to be part of the Twin
Cities' technology community.

To begin with, the PyLadies have established a set of metrics to use when 
analyzing the populations, attendees, and speakers of Twin Cities technology
groups. The team also spent the weekend learning how to scrape webpages using
Python and Beautiful Soup.

Going forward, the team will present its first analysis of a technology group
at the July Twin Cities PyMNTos meetup. The team also plans to analyze other
Twin Cities technology groups, and to apply text analysis to understand how men
and women describe themselves in Twin Cities technology groups.
