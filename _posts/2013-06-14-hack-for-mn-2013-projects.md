## Climate Crowd

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Best Commercial Opportunity</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with an Executive from GovDelivery</p>
You don’t have to be a developer to be part of a hackathon. In fact, good
hackathons include a wide variety of skills beyond software development and UI
design. Climate Crowd is a prime example of this. Aiming to help consumers make
environmentally sustainable purchases, the Climate Crowd team took the time to
seriously understand the market failures that exist today regarding
environmental sustainability. This understanding informed a business analysis
that lead to designs and a project proposal for a crowdsourced website that
will directly address one glaring market failure: a significant lack of
information regarding the environmental impact of products in services.
Described as a Yelp for the environment, Climate Crowd came out of the weekend
with a solid plan to create a marketplace based on environmental
sustainability.

## Code for Neighborhoods

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Neighborhoodiest</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with the Executive Director of E-Democracy.org</p>
Modern IT has made it much easier to communicate with people all over the
world. Yet, IT hasn’t had quite the same impact on communications with people a
block or two away. Code for Neighborhoods addressed on this paradox by creating
a prototype for a proximity based messaging system - a system that allows a
user to send messages to folks within a quarter mile instead of the whole
world. Built on Rails, Code for Neighborhoods lays the foundation for a
communications platform that will make it easy to find out who on your block
you can borrow a ladder from and alert your neighbors when you see a breakin
happening. Most importantly, Code for Neighborhoods will make it easier to get
to know the people who live in your immediate community.

## Connect Me Minneapolis

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Best Service Design</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with the CIO of the City of Minneapolis</p>
Connect Me Minneapolis, a project that will provide information on where to
find publicly accessible Internet connected computers, is another example of
how a great hackathon project can focus on research and planning instead of
coding. Foregoing programming, this team spent the weekend following a
service design approach that emphasizes research in order to understand the
true needs of the project’s intended users. Venturing out to the local library,
this team gained a deep understanding of what a wide variety of users would
demand of this project. With this deep understanding, Connect Me Minneapolis
put together a plan and presented a project that, in the words of one of the
judges, is “prime for grant money”.


## DataPark

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Most Harmonious</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: A one year subscription to ArcGIS</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Github</b>: <a href="https://github.com/michaelaltmann/Datapark" target="_blank">https://github.com/michaelaltmann/Datapark</a></p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Site</b>: <a href="http://michaelaltmann.github.io/Datapark/index.html" target="_blank">http://michaelaltmann.github.io/Datapark/index.html</a></p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Reflection</b>: <a href="http://maltmann.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://maltmann.wordpress.com/</a></p>
If you live in a city, you’re probably familiar with the pain of having to
park. Parking issues are notoriously difficult to anticipate and address when
organizations and communities are evaluating new business and residential
developments or planning events. Yet poor parking availability can kill
businesses and degrade quality of life for residents. DataPark tackled this
parking problem by spending the weekend developing a web app that models
parking supply and demand based on existing and future real estate
developments, all in the hope of bringing harmony to communities by providing
their planning committees with a powerful evaluation tool.


## mspbus.org

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Alivest</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: A one year subscription to ArcGIS</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Github</b>: <a href="https://github.com/r-barnes/mspbus" target="_blank">https://github.com/r-barnes/mspbus</a></p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Site</b>: <a href="http://www.mspbus.org" target="_blank">http://www.mspbus.org</a></p>
Bus projects are popular at civic hackathons, and Hack for MN was no exception.
The mspbus.org team launched a real-time bus tracking site within 6 hours of
meeting for the first time at Hack for MN. They utilize MetroTransit’s Nextrip
API for the real-time bus location data, and display it in an easy to use web
interface, which looks just as good on your smartphone as it does on your
desktop. When you load the site, it will ask for your location and then display
real-time arrival times for the bus stops closest to you. They built the site
for frequent bus-riders who already know which routes they're looking for, and
just want to know when the bus is actually coming. Put another way, do you have
5 minutes to enjoy your coffee, or do you need to dash out the door right now?


## My Bus Stop Totoro

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Humblest</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Github</b>: <a href="https://github.com/zzolo/totoro" target="_blank">https://github.com/zzolo/totoro</a></p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Site</b>: <a href="http://zzolo.github.io/totoro/#experiment/" target="_blank">http://zzolo.github.io/totoro/#experiment/</a></p>
Did I mention that bus apps are popular? Another team worked on real time
displays of bus information, with a focus on placing physical displays in bus
stops so people waiting at or passing by stops can know how far away the bus is
without a smartphone. Materials weren’t available to actually make physical
prototypes, so this team focused on creating digital prototypes for several
styles of information display. Made up of one of Open Twin Cities’ organizers
and the lead organizer of Visualizing Neighborhoods, this team insisted that we
not award them anything. So they went home with an award for humbleness.


## Open Wi-Fi/GPS Directory

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Critical Mass</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with the Director of Technology and Communications for the City of St. Paul</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>GitHub</b>: <a href="https://github.com/dmiddlecamp/WigleWifiUtility" target="_blank">https://github.com/dmiddlecamp/WigleWifiUtility</a></p>
Open Data doesn’t just apply to governments. Innovation can occur based on
opening up data that is only available to private companies as well. This is
the philosophy that drove the Open Wi-Fi/GPS Directory project to work on the
idea of publicly accessible directories of geolocated wifi signals. Google and
Apple currently maintain private versions of these directories, allowing them
to improve the accuracy of their location services, especially inside. This
same data, once made public, can become the basis for technologies and
businesses that help people find publicly accessible Wi-Fi or offer location
based services in the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul.


## Polling Place Finder

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Best Extension of an Existing Service</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with the Secretary of State of Minnesota</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Github</b>: <a href="https://github.com/kylereicks/hack-for-mn-telephone-polling-place-finder" target="_blank">https://github.com/kylereicks/hack-for-mn-telephone-polling-place-finder</a></p>
Participation in elections is a core component of citizenship and community
engagement. Unfortunately, many new members to a community do not vote because
they do not know where to go on Election Day. The Secretary of State of
Minnesota runs a Polling Place Finder website that aims to address this
problem, and the Polling Place Finder team was on a mission to improve this
site’s service by 1.) making it easier to use, and 2.) making it more
accessible across the digital divide. The Polling Place Finder team achieved
both of these goals with a working prototype service based entirely on text
messaging. Using this service, anybody with a phone capable of text messaging
can simply text an address to the Polling Place Finder phone number and quickly
receive the address of their polling place.


## Solvabl

<p class="project-meta"><b>Award</b>: Most Ambitious</p>
<p class="project-meta"><b>Prize</b>: Meeting with the CIO of the State of Minnesota</p>
Civic hacking doesn’t have to focus on just the tech. Solvabl hammered out a
plan for a site and organization to execute major social change by addressing
the achievement gap and technology-skilled labor shortage in Minnesota.
Solvabl’s plans include a sophisticated website that matches youth with mentors
and internships. But the real power of Solvabl’s plan is in the proposed
organization that will build and manage the network needed to matchmake and
educate companies on how to coach a diverse group of teens as they learn
technology development skills.
