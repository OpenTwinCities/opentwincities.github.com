**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Open Twin Cities Issues Open Data Questionnaire to Minneapolis Candidates

### *Asks candidates for views and plans regarding citizens' access to downloadable city data*

**Minneapolis, MN** – This week, Open Twin Cities distributed a questionnaire
to all Minneapolis Mayoral and City Council candidates concerning Open Data in
the city of Minneapolis. The questionnaire, which aims to highlight Open Data
and discover the candidates' views on this important issue, is the latest
effort by Open Twin Cities to the increase the availability and use of Open
Data in Minneapolis.

Open Data is the idea that citizens should have quick and inexpensive access to
download and use the raw data that governments control. Historically, access to
this data has only been available via formal data requests to government
entities, sometimes at significant expense. Recently, a national movement to
increase citizen access to government data has seen large cities, states, and
the federal government publish datasets on websites and data portals, inviting
everybody to download these datasets simply by clicking a link.

“PDF and paper reports are no longer enough to support accountability and
innovative problem solving. Citizens, journalists, and organizations of all
types are demanding access to government data, in a format that they can
analyze, build upon, and reuse” says Open Twin Cities Co-Captain Bill Bushey.

Candidates will have until October 1st to respond to the questionnaire. Shortly
thereafter, Open Twin Cities will share the results of candidate responses with
local media and on <http://opentwincities.org>. The questionnaire can be seen
at <http://bit.ly/MplsOpenDataQuestions>, along with a cover letter and an Open
Data FAQ.

Open Twin Cities is a community organization focused on civic improvement
through grassroots technological innovation. In partnership with public and
private organizations throughout the metro, Open Twin Cities holds large and
small events to spur the deployment of new technological tools that address
civic and community needs.
