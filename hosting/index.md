## Web Hosting Resources

Do you have a civic app that needs an online home? There are all kinds of free
website and app hosting options available, including hosting credits donated to
Open Twin Cities from Amazon and Microsoft, thanks to Code for
America. Below is a form you can fill out to let us know you'd like to make
use of these kindly donated hosting options to host your open source, civic 
tech tool on a long term basis.

In addition to the hosting resources that Open Twin Cities has, we'd like to
point out a few other free hosting options for you to consider. All of these
are easy and free to setup or try out. Plus, you don't have to wait for
