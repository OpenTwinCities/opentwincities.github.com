## Medium

Open Twin Cities is a community about having fun, exploring ideas, tackling 
problems, and meeting new people. Though it is more informal than a 
professional environment, community members and event attendees are expected 
to behave responsibly and courteously. Be kind to one another. Do not insult 
or put down other community members or event attendees. Behave civilly.

Open Twin Cities is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience 
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, 
immigrant status, religion, age, economic status, or skillset. We do not 
tolerate harassment of community members or event participants in any form. 
Sexual language and imagery, and hate speech, are not appropriate for any 
community or event activity. Members or participants violating these rules may 
be sanctioned or expelled from the community or event, without a refund, at 
the discretion of the organizers.

Open Twin Cities is a community about having fun, exploring ideas, tackling 
problems, and meeting new people. Though it is more informal than a 
professional environment, community members and event attendees are expected 
to behave responsibly and courteously. Be kind to one another. Do not insult 
or put down other community members or event attendees. Behave civilly.

Open Twin Cities is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience 
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, 
immigrant status, religion, age, economic status, or skillset. We do not 
tolerate harassment of community members or event participants in any form. 
Sexual language and imagery, and hate speech, are not appropriate for any 
community or event activity. Members or participants violating these rules may 
be sanctioned or expelled from the community event, without a refund, at 
the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender 
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, nationality, immigrant status, religion, age, economic status,
skillset, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of 
discussions or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome 
sexual attention. Members and participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member or event participant engages in harassing behavior, the
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the 
offender or expulsion from the community or event with no refund. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. During an event, 
an organizer will help the member or those experiencing harassment to feel safe
for the duration of the event (this could include contacting hotel/venue 
security, contacting local law enforcement, or providing escorts).

We value your membership and in-person attendance.

### Exhibitors and sponsors

Exhibitors or sponsors at community events or online are also subject to the 
code of conduct. In particular, exhibitors or sponsors should not use 
sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including 
volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise
create a sexualized environment.

If an exhibitor or sponsor does not follow the code of conduct, even outside 
the Open Twin Cities community activities, organizers may take appropriate 
action, including warning the offender or breaking of any non-legally-binding
agreement with no refund.
